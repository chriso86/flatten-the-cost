# Collaborators

This is meant to serve as a directory for people involved, and just contains basic information on the person and their particular skillsets.

Directory structure:

``` text
-- Frontend_Developers
    -- Christopher_Oliver.txt
```

Please create your own summary, the only information required is your name and a brief summary of your role within the project and/or your general specialization.

These records could be used for doing fuzzy searches to find collaborators with specific skills that a person may require to complete a task.

Please use .txt file format.
