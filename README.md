# Flatten the cost

Nobody wants their family to starve, nobody wants their loved ones to hurt.  
We are all people, and we should be there for one another.

## Objectives

This project as it currently stands is a research project.
If the research proves well, then this will become a development project.
The proposed end product is a digital platform that provides access into business sectors that are thriving more than others in this economic depression.
This access should be available to ANYBODY, and should be accessible on ALL devices.

We need to identify the following:

- What are the requirements?
- What are the constraints?
- What impact will this have on the industries we want to expose
- How many people will benefit from this?
- How will people benefit from this?
- What resources are required to make this happen?
- Who are we trying to help?
- When can this be available?
- What are the positive implications of this solution?
- What are the negative implications of this solution?
- How can we avert the negative implications?
- Can we get industry support?
- How can we improve on our processes?
- How can we gain access to highly skilled individuals?

In this repository, there is a project structure tailored to this list of requirements.
We need to answer each one of these questions, and maybe more that have not been identified in order to continue with development.

Highly skilled workers and researchers will likely have a greater impact on assisting with answering these questions.
But for now, we will do the best with what we have.

No profits will ever be made by this project, and any work done on this project will be pro-bono.
The repository is licensed under MIT, so anybody is welcome and encouraged to take the source code and create alternative solutions for people in need.
